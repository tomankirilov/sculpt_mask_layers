# Sculpt Mask Layers
## What is this addon doing?
This is an addon I made to solve a very specific problem - saving sculpt masks for later use and editing. In the addon preferences you can choose if you want it to sit in the side bar (N pannel) or be accessible only trough a menu (Sculpt Mode > Mask > Mask Layers). 

## Short Guide
### Assign masks to layers
Paint a mask and assign it to a layer. To access it later simply click on the little mask icon on the side of the layer.

Double click on a layer to rename it. You can organize your layer with the arrow buttons in the sidebar.

### Combine and Subtract Masks
Holding the SHIFT key while selecting a layer will add it to your current mask. Holding CTRL will subtract it.

### Mask Operators
For quick access I added buttons with some commonly used mask filters.

### All the rest
All the other buttons should be quite self-explanatory and easy to understand. Let me know if you find any issues or need help.
